        "The core idea of linear regression is to explain the variation in a given (*dependent*) variable as a linear function of a series of other (*explanatory*) variables. For example, in our case, we may want to express/explain the price of a property advertised on AirBnb as a function of some of its characteristics, such as the number of people it accommodates, and how many bathrooms, bedrooms and beds it features.

The parameters $\\beta_{1,2, 3, 4}$ give us information about in which way and to what extent each variable is related to the price, and $\\alpha$, the constant term, is the average house price when all the other variables are zero. The term $\\epsilon_i$ is usually referred to as the \"error\" and captures elements that influence the price of a house but are not accounted for explicitly. We can also express this relation in matrix form, excluding subindices for $i$ as:\n",

Indeed, one way to interpret the $\\beta_k$ coefficients in the equation above is as the degree of correlation between the explanatory variable $k$ and the dependent variable, *keeping all the other explanatory variables constant*. When you calculate simple bivariate correlations, the coefficient of a variable is picking up the correlation between the variables, but it is also subsuming into it variation associated with other correlated variables --also called confounding factors[^06-spatial-econometrics-1]. Regression allows you to isolate the distinct effect that a single variable has on the dependent one, once we *control* for those other variables.\n",

If we calculate a simple correlation between $P$ and $IMD$, the coefficient will represent the degree of association between both variables, but it will also include some of the association between $IMD$ and $NEW$. That is, part of the obtained correlation coefficient will be due not to the fact that higher prices tend to be found in areas with low IMD, but to the fact that new houses tend to be more expensive. This is because (in this example) new houses tend to be built in areas with low deprivation and simple bivariate correlation cannot account for that.\n",

These estimates are the raw equivalent of the correlation coefficient between each explanatory variable and the dependent one, once the \"polluting\" effect of the other variables included in the model has been accounted for[^06-spatial-econometrics-2]. Results are as expected for the most part: houses tend to be significantly more expensive if they accommodate more people (an extra person increases the price by `r round(m1$coefficients[[\"accommodates\"]], 3) * 100`%, approximately), have more bathrooms (`r round(m1$coefficients[[\"bathrooms\"]], 3) * 100`%), or bedrooms (`r round(m1$coefficients[[\"bedrooms\"]], 3) * 100`%). Perhaps counter intuitively, an extra bed available seems to decrease the price by about `r round(m1$coefficients[[\"beds\"]], 3) * 100`%.

Conceptually, we want to introduce space into our model whenever we think it plays an important role in the process we are interested in, or when space can act as a reasonable proxy for other factors we cannot but should include in our model. As an example of the former, we can imagine how houses at the seafront are probably more expensive than those in the second row, given their better views. To illustrate the latter, we can think of how the character of a neighborhood is important in determining the price of a house; however, it is very hard to identify and quantify \"character\" per se, although it might be easier to get at its spatial variation, hence a case of space as a proxy.\n",

This encompasses many of the kinds of spatial effects we may be interested in when we fit linear regressions. However, in other cases, our interest is on the effect of the *spatial configuration* of the observations, and the extent to which that has an effect on the outcome we are considering. For example, we might think that the price of a house not only depends on the number of bathrooms it has but, if we take number of bathrooms as a proxy for size and status, also whether it is surrounded by other houses with many bathrooms. This kind of spatial effect is fundamentally different from SH in that is it not related to inherent characteristics of the geography but relates to the characteristics of the observations in our dataset and, specially, to their spatial arrangement.

If they are not connected at all, $w_{ij}=0$, otherwise $w_{ij}>0$ and we call $i$ and $j$ neighbors. The exact value in the latter case depends on the criterium we use to define neighborhood relations. These matrices also tend to be row-standardized so the sum of each row equals to one.\n",

There are several ways to interpret this. One is that, if we take the spatial lag of bathrooms, as we said above, to be a proxy for the types of houses surrounding a property, this is probably a better predictor of how wealthy an area is than the number of bathrooms of a single property, which is more variable.
